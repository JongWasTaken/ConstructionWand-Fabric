	"description": "Construction Wands make building easier!\n\nWith a Construction Wand you can place multiple blocks (up to 1024) at once, extending your build on the side you're\nfacing. If that's not enough: you can upgrade your wand with additional cores, allowing you to place a block\nbehind the block you are facing, conjure blocks in mid air or destroy lots of blocks very fast.\n\nThis is a fabric port of Theta-Dev's original minecraft mod. May the odds continue to be in your favor.",
