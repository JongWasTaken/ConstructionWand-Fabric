# Construction Wand for Fabric

This is an unofficial port of [ConstructionWand](https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand) by Theta-Dev for Minecraft 1.20.1 (and later 1.21).  
It is currently being tested, though it seems that all features have been implemented correctly.

## Downloads
Downloads are not yet available.  
This port will be published to Modrinth and CurseForge once it is ready.
